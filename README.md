Topics Covered
File Handling
File handling refers to the process of performing operations on files, such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.

Python File Handling
Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle files. The key functions include:

open(): Opens a file and returns a file object.
read(): Reads the content of a file.
write(): Writes content to a file.
close(): Closes the file.
Python Read Files
Reading files involves opening a file and then using various methods to read its content. Common methods include:

read(): Reads the entire content of a file.
readline(): Reads one line at a time.
readlines(): Reads all lines into a list.
Python Write/Create Files
Writing or creating files involves opening a file in write mode and then using methods to write content to it. Common methods include:

write(): Writes a string to a file.
writelines(): Writes a list of strings to a file.
Python Delete Files
Deleting files involves using functions from the os module to remove files from the file system. The key function is:

os.remove(): Deletes a specified file.
